# üõë I'M NOT ADDING FEATURES FOR THIS PROJECT
As I don't have much time I can't put more features to this project as well as some other ones. I'll try to keep it working as long as it is physically possible though.  
Pull requests and Bug reports are welcome!
## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
<b>THIS SCRIPT IS NOT MEANT TO BE USED FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING YOU DO WITH THIS SCRIPT.</b>
## ‚ùì What's this?
Voice Secret Mesage is example of a script for Discord that allows you to send messages secretly without inexperienced people to notice it.  
## ‚ùì How does it work?
It uses new feature on discord called Voice Messages, basically what it does is sends audio file that works as voice message (file.mp3) to discord servers and then sends message with this voice message, the catch is - the WAVEFORM you send is actually modified. Instead of sending audio's waveform it sends one with secret message encoded to format that discord can understand.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues
<b>If you have any issues with the script, please create an issue on GitHub.</b>

## üßë‚Äçüíª More technical stuff
### üìù How is waveform stored?
Waveform is just a base64 encoded hex which includes how high and low the sound is at certain time. This way I can put any data I want into it and it will be sent as a voice message's waveform. (I'm not going to explain how I did it, because it's not that important, but if you want to know, you can ask me on dm's, links are on my profile)
### üìù How is message encoded?
To make message less obvious I encoded message the way the waveform is stored but at the beginning and ending of it I put random data, message itself before being turn into base64 is hex reversed which makes every bit of data moved to the respecive place at the end, example: `00 11 22` turns into `22 11 00`, I'm planning to add more encodings/obfuscation in the future.
<b>‚ö†Ô∏è Messages encoded with different script versions might not be decoded properly (due to changing obfuscation methods), always remember to check if you have correct version!</b>
